### Pandemic Forecasting. 

***Abstract : Todays world is suffering with one of the deadliest virus known as Corona Virus or n-COVID-19. This virus give major damage by its rate of infection. Hence for preparation we need some statistical information about this rate of infection so that we can plan for our next step. To apply machine learning, we don’t have enough data with available data we can make wrong prediction also. Hence it is very important that we cover all the parameters that is required to predict the rate of infection of such deadliest pandemic.***. 

###Introduction. 

Corona virus has some pattern , Which is seen in all the country. It has few stages such as stage 1, stage 2,  stage 3, stage 4 , stage 5. In which each level indicates. 
	
stage1 infection is because of international  citizens . In which citizens which came from outside of India brings infection and spreads infection to Indian citizens. This stage doesn’t have any mortality rate. 
	
stage2 infection is person to person transmission which has some  range of infection and can give some casualties. 
	
stage3 infection is community to community transmission which cause wide range of infection and after that Level increases on the basis of casualties. 
	
The man part is that the infected person doesn’t have ay knowledge about his infection under 14 age hence after 14 days all cases appears at the same time. Let's discuss about the architecture on which we are working.   
### Architecture

### Methodology (Process)
The expected graph of rate of COVID-19 with respect to no of days will be

   The reason behind this graph is that none of the country has completely won with this corona virus. Hence it is just infection period . The another phase is a prevention period in which the number of cases will go down and the recovery rate starts. This can be possible when the vaccination of the disease will  invent. But the thing is the vaccination requires time and till that we have to avoid the growth of infection and try to maintain the figure which is present at the peak. Where the number of cases is minimum. To make plan for minimisation we need to check the idea. Which can be done with the help of this model.
