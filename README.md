###Pandemic Forecasting
***Abstract : Todays world is suffering with one of the deadliest virus known as Corona Virus or n-COVID-19. This virus give major damage by its rate of infection. Hence for preparation we need some statistical information about this rate of infection so that we can plan for our next step. To apply machine learning, we don’t have enough data with available data we can make wrong prediction also. Hence it is very important that we cover all the parameters that is required to predict the rate of infection of such deadliest pandemic.***
###Introduction
	Corona virus has some pattern , Which is seen in all the country. It has few stages such as stage 1, stage 2,  stage 3, stage 4 , stage 5. In which each level indicates
	stage1 infection is because of international  citizens . In which citizens which came from outside of India brings infection and spreads infection to Indian citizens. This stage doesn’t have any mortality rate 
	stage2 infection is person to person transmission which has some  range of infection and can give some casualties. 
	stage3 infection is community to community transmission which cause wide range of infection and after that Level increases on the basis of casualties
The man part is that the infected person doesn’t have ay knowledge about his infection under 14 age hence after 14 days all cases appears at the same time. Let's discuss about the architecture on which we are working.
